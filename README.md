Severe weather automation for HomeAssistant and Tasker.


This repo serves as an example for automating severe weather alerts from the National Weather Service using HomeAssistant and Tasker.

****This automation is NOT intended to replace proper early warning systems, but instead supplement them. Never rely on power and internet-based warning systems as your primary alert system for severe weather.*
